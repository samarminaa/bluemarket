# Bluemarket

Repair, don't replace. That's the advice we're given, but it's hard to find those capable of fixing your favorite things. When my favorite pair of jeans develops a hole, or my 4-year old speaker stops working, or my basketball constantly deflates, it's much easier to hop on Amazon and buy a new one.

Or, at least I think it is. Taking my jeans to the tailor seems challenging. Not even sure where I would bring a speaker, or a basketball. Not to mention how much repair might cost, or how long it might take. I could get a new one tomorrow, delivered straight to my home. I could be hooping, blasting tunes, in fresh Levy's, tomorrow.

But overall, I would like for my things to remain whole, unneeding of repair. I try to buy nice, not twice. And when they break, like my phone for example, I would prefer to spend less money repairing them then buying a new one. The environment would prefer that. My local economy would prefer that too.

Repair is hard, for everyone involved. For the repairers, it requires years of learning and practicing their craft. 10,000 hours, and then 10,000 more. And once they do that, they have to navigate the treacheries of modern capitalism. Like opening a storefront, starting a website, and finding customers and to write good reviews on said website.

Many of these incredible craftspeople – from the tailors, cobblers and jewelers to furniture, phone, instrument repairers – struggle to manage it all. Hence the hard-to-find details about services, pricing, and time estimates. Many repair stores aren't even on the internet.

Bluemarket is inspired by NYC Greenmarkets. Like these quaint local farmer's markets, which bring people together to buy local goods, Bluemarket aims to bring people together to buy local repair services.

But first, it's a research project that creates a database of local repair services. The goal is to surface pricing, service offering, and repair time transparency that makes it easier for consumers to choose the repair option.
